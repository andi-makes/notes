# I accidentally use Arch now, btw

Well, how do I put this. It just happened, you know? But let's start at the beginning.
The beginning of this story. The story how I use Arch, btw.

# It starts with Windows...

Of course it does. It was a normal day. I was using [WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) to edit
some source code of [a little project of mine, my own wristwatch.](https://github.com/andi-makes/aWristWatch)

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the WSL remote extension, which served me well. I've been using
this kind of setup since WSL support for Visual Studio Code came out. It worked pretty well, nothing
to complain there. But then, something happened. Something that would change my life. Forever.

I opened the firmware folder for my wristwatch. But then, thing got weird. Somehow, my whole home
directory in WSL got deleted. I don't exactly know *how* it happened. But this was the moment where
I said to myself: "Andi, time to switch to fucking Linux". And I did. And what can I say, I don't 
look back.

*For that reason, the LIPO Charger Series will be a little bit delayed*

# Once upon a time

Years ago, I had a really underpowered laptop. This laptop didn't have a SSD and was run by a Intel Pentium
CPU. You can imagine how well it ran Windows 10. Because of performance reasons, I switched to Debian. I thought,
a stable system would be good. Well, I didn't like the fact that *seemingly every program was outdated*. When I
tried to fix it with adding recent ppa's, it broke. So, I abandoned Debian for something "less stable". This 
distro was KDE Neon.

I have good memories of KDE Neon. You could theme the shit out of KDE, it mostly just worked, and oh boy, KDE Connect
was a really nice piece of software back then. I can only imagine the KDE project got better and better over the years.
But, all good things must come to an end. My then current laptop was too big (17" screen), too slow, and it was time for
something new. I got myself an Acer Switch 5. It was an ok-ish device. It had a pen (that refused to work from time to time),
a touchscreen (which I only used for pinch and zoom) and a passively cooled Intel i5 processor. It was silent, and I *loved*
that. The downside, well, you could hear coil whine from the power brick. I began using WSL with the Ubuntu distro, just because
developing on Linux always was better than on Windows. As much as I would have loved to, I just couldn't switch to Linux
on that machine, because I was using Microsoft OneNote to take notes in class. And there just isn't OneNote on Linux.

Like I said above, all good (or bad) things come to an end though. The battery of the Acer is more than dead. 
Without power from the wall it doesn't even work anymore. So, it was time for a new Laptop.

# The chosen one

The IdeaPad 5 Pro 14" from Lenovo. It has awesome specs. A Ryzen 5800U 8 core / 16 threads processor coupled with 16GB RAM
and a dedicated GeForce MX450 Nvidia graphics card. It is nicely built. Only thing that's a *little* bit annoying is that the screen is
slightly rotated in the case. Like, less an degree. Not noticeable in normal use, but I know that it is there.

I used it with the pre-installed Windows. Then the incident happened. And now I have Arch installed alongside Windows 10.
It kind of happened.

# My Arch config

Well, just the usual craziness. [HerbstluftWM as my Window Manager](https://herbstluftwm.org/), [ly as a Display Manager](https://github.com/nullgemm/ly), [Polybar is the bar of my choice](https://polybar.github.io/),
and [Alacritty suits all my Terminals needs](https://alacritty.org/). I currently [write this note using neovim](https://neovim.io/) and I am really happy with it.

But I have to say, Arch really isn't something for the normal user that just wants something *that works*. I've put *many* hours into
customizing my Arch install to my needs, something not everybody would be willing to do.
But it really was worth it. 

I'll probably never be finished tweaking my Arch config, but well, I think that's kind of part of the Arch
experience.
